# Specification Quality Checklist: Flight Search Engine MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-16
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Exception: Explicit technical constraints mandated by challenge prompt.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - *Exception: Written for Senior Engineers per prompt.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Exception: Tech constraints.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - *Exception: Explicit tech constraints.*

## Notes

- Spec adheres to strict technical constraints provided in the prompt (Next.js, Tailwind, Amadeus).
